# Calories Burnt Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the number of calories burnt during exercise based on various features such as age, gender, height, weight, and duration of the exercise. The model is built using XGBoost Regressor.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Data visualization for better understanding
- Correlation analysis
- Model training using XGBoost Regressor
- Performance evaluation using Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Project Structure

- `calories.csv`: Contains the calorie data.
- `exercise.csv`: Contains the exercise data.
- `Calories Burnt Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all the steps from data loading to model evaluation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, xgboost

## Installation
